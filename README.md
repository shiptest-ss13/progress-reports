# Shiptest Progress Reports Repository

## How to add a report

To add a new report, simply add a new markdown (.md) file to the [reports](reports) subdirectory. You can use [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/) flavoured markdown and it will all be turned into HTML for the webpage at [the shiptest progress reports page](https://progress.shiptest.net) when the file is pushed to the master branch on github.

The full listing of all progress reports, and not just the most recent ones, is located [here](https://progress.shiptest.net/all.html).

## The script

The entire script is contained in [the main.py file](main.py). Ask Mark before making any direct changes to it, or just make a pull request.
